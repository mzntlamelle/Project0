        The available classes at Boqate ACL High School are:
      <ul>
        <li><a href ="#Form A">Form A<a/>
        <li><a href ="#Form B">Form B<a/>
        <li><a href ="#Form C">Form C<a/>
        <li><a href ="#Form D">Form D<a/>
        <li><a href ="#Form E">Form E<a/>
      </ul>
      <Div  id = "Form A"><h4>FORM A</h4>
        <p>
          This is the entry point into the secodary level of Lesotho education from primary schools. The entry requirement into Form A is a pass at primary school, that is,
          a student has to pass the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Boqate ACL High School is a developing school, as such admission is not restrictive, and any
          who applyies can quarantee admission. In addition, the student should have the minimum age of 12 and maximum age of 15.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Form A class divided into two sub-classes, namely A1 and A2. A1 as stated in the <a href = "index.html">home</a> page consists of brighter students, that is
          students who obtained good grades in thier PSLE, while A2 consists of the remaining students. The students will then be reshuffled after writing thier internal
          mid term examinations, and those who performed well will be in A1, while A2 will contain poor performers. At the end of Form A, each student will write an internal
          examination which, after successfull completion, will result in the students proceed to <a href = "#Form B">Form B</a>. If the students does not successfull pass
          the examination, then they will be required to repeat the class.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div  id = "Form B"><h4>FORM B</h4>
        <p>
          Form B is class that a student goes to after suucessfully completing Form A. This class is a continuing progress of the junior certificate, more content that
          started in Form A is improved here and students are equiped with more information. No new subjects are introduced here except to the newly registered students.
          Admissions are welcome from students outside Boqate ACL. The students in this class should have age ranging from 13 to 16. Like in <a href = "#Form A">Form A</a>,
          Form B can be divided into several subclasses, B1, B2, B3, e.t.c depending on the number of te students. B1 normally consists of the brighter students who are the
          descendents of Boqate (i.e. who did Form A in this school). The Last subclass - say - B3, will contain the new entrants and the descendents of Boqate with weaker
          perfomanance. The students will then be reshufled after writing the internal winter examinations. At the end of Form B, each student will write an internal
          examination which, after successfull completion, will result in the students proceed to <a href = "#Form C">Form C</a>. If the students does not successfull pass
          the examination, then they will be required to repeat the class.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div  id = "Form C"><h4>FORM C</h4>
        <p>
          Form C is the last class of JC. At the end of this class each student is expected to take a national examination that is is set and monitored and assessed by the
          Examination Council of Lesotho (ECOL) and when the students have passed this examinations, they will be awarded with a JUNIOR CERTIFICATE. Like
          <a href = "#Form A">Form A</a> and <a href = "#Form B">Form B</a>, students will placed in different subclasses depending on thier Form B performance. No
          re-shuffling is done for the Form C students as the students should be focusing on the National final examinations
        </p>
      </div>

      <div  id = "Form D"><h4>FORM D</h4>
        <p>
          Form D is the entry point of LGCSE, and the entry requirement are a pass in JC. The Form D class is divided into four subclasses depending on the choice of the
          students of the optional subjects. The subclasses are divided into students who chose:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Agriculture and Accounting
          <li>Agriculture and Biology
          <li>Business Studies and Biology
          <li>Business Studies and Accounting
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note that the four subclasses does not mean four claasrooms. Actually, since the are two options, only two classrooms can be used. A more detailed information on
          subjects is found <a href = "subject.html">here.</a>. Since classes are divided using the subject choices of the pupils, it is impossible to reshuffle the pupils.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id = "Form E"><h4>FORM E</h4>
        <p>
         Form E is the continuation of Form D and an exit point of LGCSE. At the end of this class, the students are expected to sit for the national examinations called
         Lesotho General Certificate of Secondary Education LGCSE that is assessed by ECOL. Students has to pass <a href="#Form D">Form  D</a> to reach Form E. Students
         who successfully pass the LGCSE can smoothly apply for any <a href="https://selibeng.com/colleges-universities/"> tertiary institution</a> in the country and pursue
         their desired dreams.
