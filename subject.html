              The subjects taught at Boqate ACL are categorised into two departments, namely the department of Mathematics and Science headed by Mrs Moneri and the
              department of social sciences headed by Mr. Lipholo. These subjects are taught at two different but complemtary levels. These level are the Junior
              Certificate (JC) and Lesotho General Certificate of Secondary Education (LGCSE), the entry level being JC, and LGCSE being the exit level. The departments
              each provide the following subjects.
            </p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-12"  id="MASC"><h4>Department of Mathematics and Science</h4>
                <p>
                  In this department the are basically three subjects available taught at both JC and LGCSE level.

                <p>
                  Agricultural Science or simply agriculture, introduces students to two forms of agriculture, which are crop plantation and animal rearing. In each form,
                  the students learn the contemporary and standard means of applying them. New concepts are introduced at this level, whereby students are equiped with
                  morden techniquies of agriculture.
                  <br>
                   The final assessment of the students taking this subject is done in two ways; the practical assessment, which focuses on the crops, and the animals
                   kept by the school.
                </p>
                <h6 id=JC_Science>Science</h6>
                <p>
                  Science is categorised into three disciplines of science which are Biology, Chemistry and Physics.
                  <br>
                  Biology add more to the content learnt at Primary schools, these concepts include microbiology through learning of cell biology, plant biology and animal
                   biology(vetebrates and invetebrates). Students are further exposed to using scientific tools to perform experiments and observations.
                   <br>
                   Chemistry at this stage focuses on introdiction to atoms and the structures made up of an atom, including chemical reactions and their applications to
                   life.
                   <br>
                   Physics introduces students to the concepts measurements, and quantities that applied in everyday life. These quantities include among others time,
                   distance, mass, weight and their applications. The examples of these appllications are seen in things like force, speed and more applications like
                   waves.
                </p>
                <h6 id=JC_Mathematics>Mathematics</h6>
                <p>
                  Mathematics concepts and their applications. At this stages students learnt how to substitute letters for numbers and apply the mathematical approach to
                  those letters to solve every day problems.

                <p>
                  This an optional subject, and students are to choose either Agriculture and Biology.<br>
                  Agricultural concepts are extended from what was learnt from Junior secondary. At the end of this course, each student is to write an examination and
                  also work on thier own project. This project is to be in either plants or animals depending on the choice of the pupils. A good credit in this subject
                  will prepare the student for further study in the agriculture and biological science.

                <h6 id=biology>Biology</h6>
                <p>
                  Biology or Agriculture, the student has to choose between one of the two.<br>
                  Students taking Biology learn animal biology and plant biology, and are preparing to pursue courses in animal and human health and botany.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The LGCSE Mathematics continues the contents leant from JC Mathemamatics.  It is divided into two curriculums, the core curriculum and the extended
                  curriculum. The core curriculum is limited and provides the basics of Mathematics it is graded C to G, The extended curriculum prepares students
                  to proceed in Mathematics, Science and Engineering, it is graded A* to G.

                <p>
                  The LGCSE Physical Science continues the contents leant from JC Sciecne but focuses only on Physics and Chemistry. Like Mathematics, Physical Science
                  is divided into two curriculums, the core curriculum and the extended curriculum. The core curriculum is limited and provides the basics of
                  Physical Science it is graded C to G. The extended curriculum prepares students to proceed in Science, Engineering and Medicine, it is graded A* to G.
